# FAQ Project - IS 218
**_By: Melissa Alzate, Kyle Kreinheder, Julianna Cole, and William Gleason_**


**_Introduction_**

The feature that has been created helps students, professors and even faculty to 
communicate with one another. The feature can be accessed by anyone and allows the 
users to like or dislike an idea, statement or anything that the user would have 
posted. Users will also be able to answer questions and post reactions to ideas of 
other users.

User Stories • Post questions, ideas, statements, etc. • Users can answer or react 
to posted comments • Users can communicate on a public forum • Users can like and 
dislike the posted comment •    Users can use the public to help inform decisions

**_To Run Our Project_**
1. Git Clone: https://github.com/ma867/faqProject.git or https://github.com/kkreinheder/FAQ.git
2. Change directory (CD) into FAQ and run "composer install"
3. Rename .env.example to .env
4. Run: php artisan key:generate

Note: All features of our project are functional when ran locally on Chrome.
This project is hosted on Heroku at https://faqtrial1.herokuapp.com/ or https://fathomless-eyrie-17644.herokuapp.com/.
The project can be ran on Chrome with Heroku, but features that use SQLite will
result in a "500: Server Error" or will display errors because of the incompatibility 
between Heroku and SQLite.

**_Group Work_**

The four members of our group met up several times over the course of two weeks to complete 
this project.  We did this project collaboratively but used two separate repositories for 
troubleshooting purposes.  All commits were done together as a team.
